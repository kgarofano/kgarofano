- 👋 Hi, I’m @kgarofano
- 👀 I’m interested in cats, sci-fi, gaming, dogs, research science, agriculture, back-end software dev, coding for games, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java programming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically anything. I want to learn as much as I can about as many things as I can. 
- 📫 How to reach me almost everything is connected to my phone in some capacity so a message on here is likely the best first step towards communication.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a 7yr old Australian shepherd mix whom I love very very much and is also a mega pain in the butt.
